    </h2>
    <p>
        David Lionel Baddiel born 28 May 1964, is an English comedian, novelist, columnist, and

        The Mary Whitehouse Experience and partnership with Frank Skinner. Baddiel is also a screenwriter and
        a published novelist.

        Baddiel was born on 28 May 1964 in Troy, New York, and moved to the UK with his parents when he was four months
        old.[3][1] He is the second of three sons.
        His parents were both from Jewish families. His father, Colin Brian Baddiel, was Welsh-born from a working-class
        background and worked as a research chemist with Unilever before being made redundant in the 1980s, after which
        he sold Dinky Toys at Grays Antique Market.
        His mother, Sarah, was German-born, and was a five-month-old refugee child when she was brought to the United
        Kingdom in 1939 by her parents after
        escaping from Nazi Germany, where her father, Ernst Fabian, a victim of the Kristallnacht pogrom, had been
        stripped of his assets. Soon after their
        arrival, Fabian was interned as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man for a year. He had mental health issues,
        sometimes requiring hospitalisation, for the rest of his life.[6]
        Baddiel grew up in Dollis Hill, Willesden, north London. He attended primary school at the North West London
        Jewish Day School in Brent, and was then
        educated at The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in Elstree, a public school near Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.
        He studied English at King's College, Cambridge,
        where he was a member of the Cambridge Footlights, and graduated with a double first Bachelor of Arts (BA)
        degree. He began studies for a PhD
        in English at University College London but did not complete it.

        After leaving university, Baddiel became a
        professional stand-up comedian in London, as well as a writer for acts such as Rory Bremner and series
        including Spitting Image. His first television appearance came in one episode of the showbiz satire Filthy,
        Rich and Catflap. In 1988 he was introduced to Rob Newman, and the two formed a writing partnership.
        Subsequently,
        paired up with Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis, another comedy duo, they began writing and performing in The Mary
        Whitehouse
        Experience on BBC Radio 1, where the show ran for four series and a special. This success led the show to
        transfer to
        BBC2, where it ran for two series, after which both duos decided to end the show. During this time, Baddiel also
        co-hosted the Channel 4 programme A Stab in the Dark.
        After The Mary Whitehouse Experience, Baddiel and Newman re-teamed up for Newman and Baddiel in Pieces, which
        ran for seven
        episodes on BBC2, featuring character sketches, monologues and observation routines. Despite a fraught working
        relationship, the show saw Newman and Baddiel find enormous success as live performers, held up as examples of
        comedy as
        ‘the new rock ’n’ roll’, with their tour (Newman and Baddiel: Live and In Pieces) culminating in the first ever
        sold-out gig for a comedy act at Wembley Arena, playing to 12,500 people.[11] Despite this success, increasing
        tension
        between the pair led to them announcing the tour would be their last together. Their final tour was the subject
        of a BBC2
        documentary, Newman and Baddiel on the Road to Wembley.

        Baddiel subsequently met and began sharing a flat with fellow comedian Frank Skinner. Both lifelong
        football fans (Baddiel is a Chelsea F.C. fan), the pair created, wrote and performed Fantasy
        Football League, a popular entertainment show based on the
        growing fantasy football craze. Running for three series on BBC2,
        followed by a series of live specials throughout the 1998 World Cup
        and then again through the 2004 European Championship, as well as a series of podcasts for The
        Times from Germany at the 2006 World Cup, and another series for Absolute Radio from South
        Africa during the 2010 World Cup (amassing over 3 million downloads). During this time the
        duo also twice topped the UK Singles Chart with the football anthem "Three Lions", co-written and
        performed with The Lightning Seeds. The song was originally written as the England football
        team's official anthem for UEFA Euro 1996 and was subsequently re-recorded with updated lyrics as the unofficial
        anthem
        for the 1998 World Cup. The song won the hearts of many England fans and has had unofficial
        re-writes for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
        After ending Fantasy Football League, the pair took an improvised question-and-answer show to the
        Edinburgh Fringe which then became a television series, Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned, which ran for
        five series on ITV, as well as a West End run at the Shaftesbury Theatre in 2001.
        The pair also appeared on a celebrity special of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in 2001, becoming the first
        celebrity contestants to reach
        £250,000 for their charities, the Catholic Children's Society and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.
        On the Official UK Charts on 13 July 2018, the song Three Lions by Baddiel, Frank Skinner and The Lightning
        Seeds also re-entered the
        charts at Number 1, celebrating the progress of the England national football team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup
        with the phrase
        "it's coming home" featuring heavily on social media and television.

        Baddiel has received criticism for his blackface impression of black footballer Jason Lee on
        the programme, which involved him wearing a pineapple on his head and blacking up. Lee said he
        considered this a form of bullying. Baddiel has issued a number o
        f apologies on social media and in an article for The Daily Telegraph,
        saying it was "part of a very bad racist tradition", but Lee said in 2020
        that he had never received a direct apology from Baddiel or co-host Frank
        Skinner over the series of sketches. According to Lee, "It wasn't like I was
        looking for one, but I've never met them in person. If I met them in person, it's
        a conversation we would have." He added, "Baddiel and Skinner, did they realise the
        impact of what they were saying, how it affected so many people? Especially a hairstyle,
        you're talking about ethnicity, a lot of black people would wear dreadlocks and feel deeply
        offended by someone who’s getting mocked for a
        similar hairstyle. The implications were far wider, and it wouldn't happen today."
